---

## Step 7: Full Testing (Optional)

For comprehensive testing, follow the detailed guide:

**`INTEGRATION-TESTING-GUIDE.md`** - Full test suite with:
- Detailed responsiveness checks
- Accessibility testing
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance optimization checks
- Edge case testing

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Gallery doesn't show images
**Solution:** Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache

### Variants don't update price
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for JS errors
- Open Console tab
- Look for red error messages
- Check that `product-info-agent2.js` loaded (Network tab)

### Mobile layout broken
**Solution:** Clear cache and refresh
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button → "Empty cache and hard refresh"

### Accordion doesn't expand
**Solution:** Check that JS file loaded
- Network tab → filter by "agent3"
- Should see `product-extras-agent3.js` with 200 status

### Dev server isn't updating
**Solution:** Restart the dev server
```powershell
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart:
shopify theme dev
```
